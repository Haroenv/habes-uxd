# Website tables, page tables and sketches

A website table is a method used by this class to mark common elements on a webpage. Each important page has a page table, which lists all of the relevant elements on that page. Each important page has also been sketched with pencil and shaders. The sketches are done for both the desktop as the mobile interface.
