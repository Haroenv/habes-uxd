This is a user experience design project made for Odisee University College Ghent in the academic year 2015-2016.

Most of this project will be in Dutch, but can be translated if necessary.

Habes is a platform that tracks who has materials in an organisation (profit or non-profit) and organises who has certain materials (projectors, tablets, books ...).
